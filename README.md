# Mapping_Earthquakes
 
Hello, this is my analysis for the mapping earthquakes challenge. This challenge primarily used leaflet, javascript, and html. The purpose is to show earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes on a map. Each with its own style of markers and popups to display information. Below are some pictures showcasing the html page that derives from the javascript file. There is also an API being called through mapbox which allows the nice image. Data is also being pulled through JSON files from earthquake.usgs.gov.
